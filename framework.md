## How I view things

The below is my model of how I think about things. Like all models, this is not perfect, and every rule has exceptions. However, the spirit of the statements, when taken together, describe how I view the world.

People care about two broad kinds of things, we will call them: 

- **Natural** things - survival, food, water, shelter, procreation, health, safety, comfort, curiosity, entertainment, travel, etc.
- **Artificial** things - money, innovation, companies, jobs, marriage, religion, government, law, politics, language, marketing, selling, management, family, social media, etc.

It is in our intrinsic, primal nature to care about the natural things. But why did we humans create and begin to care about these artificial things?

If we had an abundance of all the natural things needed, more than people need or desire, we would not have the need for any of these artificial things. Everyone would have everything they needed or wanted, and people would live in perfect harmony. 

However, there are usually way more people than there are resources that they need or desire. Why is that?

1. We have the **division of labor** argument: Creating the things that we desire requires work. And there are many kinds of work needed, as the number of people increase and as the complexity of things we desire increases. Every individual cannot create all the things that they need or desire. So, they divide up the work. This requires more people - the more the people, the less work each has to do. 
2. The more people that are `with me`, the safer I am against attacks from external forces (nature, animals, other people).
3. The more the people, the more the things needed to keep them happy. And that in turn needs even more people, to ideate, create, sell, manage.

We will also have some terms to describe things. There are **types** of things. There are **items**, each of which belong to types. There are **instances** of items that are copies of items in physical space. For example, food is a type of thing, sliced bread is an item, and a particular loaf of bread I have is an instance of bread. 

Consider  a given person, or group of people. 
- They have a relationship of **needing** or **desiring** things, in which case such things are categorized as **needed/unneeded** or **desired/undesired**. 
- Of all types, some types are needed, others are not needed. Some are desired, while others are undesired (by that person or group). 
- Similarly, For any given type there are needed/unneeded/desired/undesired items. 
- Similarly, For any given item there are needed/unneeded/desired/undesired instances.
- For example, a poor farmer may need food or water, but not really need or desire (or even know about) the latest iphone. A rich kid may also need food or water, but not care about it, but they may desire the latest iphone.

Some people realize all this, explicitly or in some equivalent implicit form, and decide to use this knowledge to their advantage. (let’s call them **leaders**). Others who don’t realize this, let’s call them the **followers**.

Now, the leader wants to get enough of the natural things that all people need/desire. They would like to have an excess of those so they don't fall short when times change.

The leaders realize that one way to ensure this is to keep the number of leaders small, and the number of followers big. To achieve this, the leaders follow certain tricks:
1. Leaders take efforts to ensure followers do not think in these terms.
2. Leaders keep followers busy with so many things that they do not realize this.
3. Leaders give followers many choices to pick from, giving them the illusion of control as well as keeping them busy.
4. These artificial/false/fake choices of things can be given in the form of more types, more items, more instances.
5. Leaders are also aware of **manipulation techniques** in psychology and social and media theory to:
   1. Addict followers to some of the artificial choices, such as money, social media, religion, etc. Leaders know that addicts will beget more addicts.
   2. Keep engaged enough to control, but just short of getting addicted to these artificial choices. Example: Many tech CEOs refused to give their children access to social media. Drug dealers are not addicts of their own drugs.
   3. Keep followers from caring too much about the scarce needed/desired natural choices, that they would prefer to keep more for themselves. Make them focus more on the bad false choices they are made to believe in, are addicted to, etc.
6. There are some artificial choices that are not as bad as others, and are necessary for social harmony and provide some convenience. However, due to this mess of natural and artificial choices, with everyone trying to get everyone addicted to/believing in/caring about different things, it is hard to determine which artificial choices are necessary, and in what form and to what degree.

On a more concrete level, leaders can keep followers at bay by:
1. Increasing desire in things they want followers to consume more, get addicted to, recruit others to accept. This is done through advertising, selling, marketing.
2. Create more types of things that they want followers to consume, and 'pay' the leaders for them.
3. Create more items for each type that leaders wouldn't consume themselves. Then, sell/advertise them to followers to make them buy these, get addicted to, recruit others to consume as well.
4. Create more instances of items meant for followers.

The consequence of all this is an increasing divide between leaders and followers. This will be eventually self destructive, because followers will eventually 'die' or hit horrible lows, like drug addicts, but in this case, due to the subtler nature and cycle of the drug, not even knowing why they feel so crappy or low. What is the moral way out of this imbalance?

I hate that I am a follower in many things. I also hate to become a leader (as described above), since it is the cause of much that is bad in the world, and I consider it immoral to do so. I have often given up several opportunities to become a leader. I have been on a mission to define a middle ground - call it **individuals** - that live well without having to become evil leaders or manipulated followers.

These are my principles (work in progress) for being an individual:
1. I believe it is possible for each of us to contribute to solving the demand supply gap (number of people and the resources needed to keep them happy) in morally better ways (than the manipulative ones listed above), called **innovation**: 
   1. Create better items and instances of natural highly desired or needed types of things.
   2. Create more efficient supply chains of these resources so more people can have them - more efficient production, more efficient distribution, etc.
2. Be extra judicious not to become a part of the morally corrupt system of leaders manipulating followers. If someone cannot justify why he or she is doing something, do not accept it from that person. Question anything, fiercely, socratically, that someone claims to be obviously good for 'everybody', or that they are doing for others, without giving full reasons as to why they stand behind this. In many cases, these are people who are either manipulated into believing what they believe in (addicts recruiting other addicts), or are manipulating others into what they do not themselves believe in (leaders advertising to followers).
3. I implied that most artificial things are evil (false choices created by leaders for followers, but not themselves). However, there are a few that are genuinely needed to maintain social harmony. Start with the bare minimum you can afford to live with - for me, at this time, these are:
   1. True and sincere compassion and empathy for other humans.
   2. An identification and extra compassion and empathy for loved ones (a small subset of family, friends, etc.).
   3. Ignore or accept others' choices, as long as it does not affect me or my loved ones.
4. The only exception to accepting things that are not fully justified is to stay within the bounds of the law (legal or social or cultural), so that you do not get in trouble or ostracized.
5. It is ok, even necessary to question the social or cultural 'givens' without breaking the law. If within your capacity to do so, effect change to the legal law where it is not justified.
6. Show, by example, that it is possible to be an individual - this is the largest work in progress part. I have tried and failed many times, at much personal loss to myself and my loved ones, but am still persevering, believing it is possible.
7. Be bold enough to sell and profit, to assert your rights, to enjoy what you have earned.
8. This is not so much a principle, as an example: In the life quest to earn money, emphasize earning over the money. If I do not feel I justify what I am getting, find a better place where I feel that I am giving at least as much as I am getting.

These principles are far from complete, or validated. However, these form a framework to avoid being evil or being manipulated, and yet doing right and good by myself and others.
